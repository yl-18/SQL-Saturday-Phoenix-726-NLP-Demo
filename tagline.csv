The bone had holes in it - it was a flute. The man took the flute and began to play it. The music turned into a song, and the voice singing the song begged the man to look for the other bones of a body scattered here and there. So the man and his mother set off following every path - that of God and those of the devil -, looking for the bones so that they could put the skeleton of the Christian man back together again and give him a Christian burial. And they saw what they saw, and lived what they lived. Many a story. And although they never told their tale to anyone, others told it for them."

2002,"  The film takes us on a dreamlike journey in an imaginary land, Cofralandes, a country at the end of the world, or, if one prefers, outside the world. Far-off Chile is shown through the eyes of three travellers: a Frenchman, a German and an Englishman. Accompanying them is a camera behind which is a narrator: a Chilean who re-discovers the strange country that is his homeland - land of dreams and nightmares. Extravagant characters appear before the camera, unusual situations are created, and images are invented from a place whose sweetness wounds and kills; a country whose sole distinctive sign is precisely absence; a place where the absence of colour is the local colour. And yet, little by little, from this sort of Sargasso Sea, images and situations emerge here and there in which pleasure and uncontrollable laughter are revealed as jolly companions to pain and incertitude - but also in which a massacre lurks in a child's poem and an earthquake, in a smile."

Masters of Discipline is, to be sure, the most bizarre and most unconventional film ever shown. In fact, it's too much for some people. Perhaps you should think twice about seeing it... HOW DO WE WARN YOU ABOUT SUCH A MOVIE? Never has the audience reaction to a movie been so diverse. Some people find this film offensive, distasteful and even gross . Others find it enlightening and most enjoyable. We realize some will be upset or outraged if they see Masters of Discipline without proper WARNING. And we don't want to offend anyone.

If you have any reservations about it, DON'T plan to see - Masters of Discipline . A SERIOUS WARNING! Some movie ads have carried warnings which turned out to be frivolous. Because the movies themselves were a big joke. Masters of Discipline is no laughing matter. It's the real thing. If you see it without proper warning, you may be offended.
